# MART 191 - Creative Coding - Course Description

The goal for this course is to begin a journey in which the creative and technical possibilities of the computer becomes an tool in your palate. The goal for this tool, or rather set of tools, is for them to become an extension of you, something you think through, express yourself through, and can contribute to the world through. 
Ultimately, this course is designed to offer you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. The course focuses on the fundamentals of programming the computer (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) while also touching on a few advanced topics, and relating this all back to the creative and expressive possibilities of media art. 
The JavaScript-based 'p5.js' programming framework will be utilized within this class.
The course will conclude, with your design, development, and implementation of a final project of your choosing.
