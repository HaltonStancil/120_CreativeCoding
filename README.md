## COURSE OVERVIEW
The goal for this course is to begin a journey in which the creative and technical possibilities of the computer becomes an tool in your palate. The goal for this tool, or rather set of tools, is for them to become an extension of you, something you think through, express yourself through, and can contribute to the world through. Ultimately, this course is designed to offer you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. The course focuses on the fundamentals of programming the computer (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) while also touching on a few advanced topics, and relating this all back to the creative and expressive possibilities of media art. The JavaScript-based 'p5.js' programming framework will be utilized within this class. The course will conclude, with your design, development, and implementation of a final project of your choosing.

<!--

### 15 -- One on one speed user testing / feedback
(December)
- This week you will "user test" your project with fellow classmates. You must have some implementation that you can test completed by this time.  User testing can mean different things for different projects. For a game, it can mean that the user tries to play it. For an art piece, it could mean showing it to a classmate and asking for them to say what they think it is about or how it made them feel. We'll show projects in a "one on one" / round robin / speed dating-style session. 5 minutes then switch. You cannot not explain your project, just show and let the user try it and give you feedback. Then you can answer questions.  User testing schedule will be provided on a wiki.

### Final Presentations - Monday, December 12th in Class
- Please add your link to your final project documentation on the wiki.
